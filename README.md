dockerized-viewvc
=================

A Dockerized ViewVC + SVN + CVS stack (for testing purposes)

**NOTE: This project is for testing purposes only.**


Requirements
------------

This sucker uses Docker CE (17.09+) with support for Docker Compose
file format 3.4.  For more information, see
https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/.


Preparing the Environment
-------------------------

After you clone the repository and have installed Docker, download all
of the containers for the apps that will be run in Docker.

    $ docker-compose pull

You'll need to repeat this command any time you want to fetch the
latest version of these containers.

The primary application container here, though, doesn't get pulled.
It gets built:

    $ docker-compose build


Configuring the Stack
---------------------

This stack gives you the optional of running ViewVC either using its
Python-based standalone server, or as a WSGI application under Apache
HTTP Server.

1. Copy the `docker-compose.yml.template` file to `docker-compose.yml`

2. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to set the value of the
   `VIEWVC_MODE` environment variable to one of the following, as
   suits your desired mode of operation:  `cgi`, `wsgi`, or
   `standalone`

3. By default, the Docker stack will expose the service on host port
   8080.  If you want to use a different port, replace 8080 with the
   port of your choice in the "ports" mapping.


Running the Stack
-----------------

Once you've built the primary container, pulled the dependency
containers, and created your `docker-compose.yml` file, you can start
the stack in the background (daemon mode) using `docker-compose up
-d`.

Once the stack fully starts, you should be able to access ViewVC by
hitting http://localhost:8080/viewvc in your web browser.  (If you
configured the stack to expose the service on a different port than
8080, then make the obvious port number substitution in that URL.)

Stopping the browser is as simple as running `docker-compose down`.
